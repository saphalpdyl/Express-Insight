# Express Insight

## Overview
Express Insight is a logging middleware for Express.js applications. This project aims to provide detailed insights into incoming requests and outgoing responses in an Express application, helping developers better understand and debug their web applications.

## Features
- [ ] Detailed request/response logging
- [ ] Error handling and logging
- [ ] Context-aware logging (includes the file path where the log was triggered)
- [ ] Configurable log levels and output formats

## Usage
Here's a basic implementation of the core plugin with the error plugin

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import ExpressInsight from 'express-insight';

const app = express();

const expInsight = ExpressInsight.setupExpressInsight(app, {
  projectName: "Local Project",
  error: {
    enable: true,
  },
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

expInsight.setupErrorPlugin();
app.listen(3000);
```

## Future Improvements
As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I plan to enhance Express Insight with:
- Custom log formatting options
- Performance metrics logging
- Unit tests for reliability
