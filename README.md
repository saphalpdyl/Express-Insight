# Express Insight

## Overview
Express Insight is a logging middleware for Express.js applications. This project aims to provide detailed insights into incoming requests and outgoing responses in an Express application, helping developers better understand and debug their web applications.

## Features
- Detailed request/response logging
- Error handling and logging
- Context-aware logging (includes the file path where the log was triggered)
- Configurable log levels and output formats

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how Express Insight will be used in an Express application:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import setupExpressInsight from 'express-insight';

const app = express();

setupExpressInsight(app, {
  projectName: "Example Project",
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I've gained experience with:
- Node.js and Express.js
- Middleware development
- ES6+ features and ES Modules
- Error handling in Express
- Working with file paths in Node.js

## Future Improvements
As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I plan to enhance Express Insight with:
- Custom log formatting options
- Performance metrics logging
- Unit tests for reliability

## Contribution
This is a personal project for learning purposes, but I'm open to suggestions and feedback. Feel free to open an issue if you have ideas on how I can improve this project or my coding practices.
