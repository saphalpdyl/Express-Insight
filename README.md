# Express Insight

## Overview
Express Insight is a logging middleware for Express.js applications. This project aims to provide detailed insights into incoming requests and outgoing responses in an Express application, helping developers better understand and debug their web applications.

## Usage
Here's a basic implementation of the core plugin with the error plugin

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import ExpressInsight from 'express-insight';

const app = express();

const expInsight = ExpressInsight.setupExpressInsight(app, {
  projectName: "Local Project",
  error: {
    enable: true,
  },
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

expInsight.setupErrorPlugin();
app.listen(3000);
```
